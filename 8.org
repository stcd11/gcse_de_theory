** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

* Ferrous Metals
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Ferrous metals are metals that contain Iron (ferrite). This makes most of them have magnetic properties.
- Because ferrous metal contain Iron, they are prone to corrosion (rust) when exposed to moisture, the only 2 exceptions are, stainless steel and wrought iron.
- Materials properties.
** Mild Steel
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Properties* - Tough, ductile, malleable, magnetic, high tensile strength, easily joined, poor corrosion resistance.
- *Composition* - Iron + 0.1 - 0.3% carbon.
- *Melting point* - 1400 degress celcius.
- *Example uses* - Screws, nails, bolts, girders and car body panels.

** Stainless Steel
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Properties* -  Corrosion resistant, hard, tough, sometimes magnetic, resists wear, difficult to cut. Specific properties can be altered by varying the alloy metals.
- *Composition* - Carbon steel(which contains Iron) + 10.5 - 18% chromium + 8% nickel + 8% manganese.
- *Melting point* - 1400 degress celcius.
- *Example uses* - Kitchenware, sinks, cutlery, medical equipment.
** Cast iron
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Properties* -  Hard skin, brittle, soft core, good compressive strength, self lubricating, magnetic.
- *Composition* - Iron + 2-6% carbon.
- *Melting point* - 1200 degress celcius.
- *Example uses* - Machine parts, vices, brake discs and manhole covers.

* Non Ferrous Metals
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- These metals do not contain Iron. 
- This means that they are not magnetic.
- They are also very resistant to corrosion (rust).
- As they do not contain Iron, they are softer and are therefore more malleable (easy to shape and bend).
** Aluminium
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Properties* -  Greyish white, corrosion resistant, malleable, ductile, easily machined, good heat/electrical conductor, excellent strength to weight ratio and polishes well.
- *Composition* - Pure metal.
- *Melting point* - 660 degress celcius.
- *Example uses* - Aircraft parts, foil, window frames, engine parts,and drinks cans.
** Copper
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Properties* -   Reddish brown, corrosion resistant, malleable, ductile, tough,  easily machined, good heat/electrical conductor, good hot or cold working and polishes well.
- *Composition* - Pure metal.
- *Melting point* - 1100 degress celcius.
- *Example uses* - Electrical wire, gas and water pipes, printed circuit board (PCB) tracks and roofing.
** Brass
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Properties* -  Yellow, corrosion resistant, easliy machined, good heat/electrical conductor, casts well, harder than copper and polishes well.
- *Composition* - Alloy, 65% copper and 35% zinc
- *Melting point* - 900-940 degress celcius.
- *Example uses* - Plumbing fittings, door fittings, locks and musical intruments.

* Mechanical Properties
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- The mechanical properties of metals define how they react to forces.
- A large form will deform metal.
- A temporary change is called 'elasic' deformation (it will spring back into its original shape).
- A permanent change is called 'plastic' deformation.
- Three properties of materials are ductility, malleability and hardness.
- All *ductile* materials are *malleable*, but not all *malleable* materials are *ductile*.
- Hard materials are often brittle (crack easily), with a low resistance to impact, and break easily.
- This property is important for cutting tools such as saws, drills and files.
- Diamond is the hardest naturally occuring materials and is measured at 10 on the Mohs scale (the scales that measures hardness).
- the mineral talc is 1 and aluminium is 2-2.9 and steels are 5-8.5.
