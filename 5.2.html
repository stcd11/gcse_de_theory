<ul class="org-ul">
<li>LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used to detect light levels, for example, in automatic security lights. Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In the dark and at low light levels, the resistance of an LDR is high, and little current can flow through it.
</li>
<li>In bright light, the resistance of an LDR is low, and more current can flow through it.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>LDRs are also useful for controlling how long the shutter should remain open on a digital camera. Changes in the resistance are measured and, if the light level is low, the shutter stays open for longer than if the light level is high.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A light-emitting diode (LED) is a special kind of diode that glows when electricity passes through it.
</li>
<li>Most LEDs are made from a semi-conducting material called gallium arsenide phosphide.
</li>
<li>LEDs can be bought in a range of colours. They can also be bought in forms that will switch between two colours (bi-colour), three colours (tri-colour) or emit infra-red light.
</li>
<li>In common with all diodes, the LED will only allow current to pass in one direction.
</li>
<li>The cathode is normally indicated by a flat side on the casing and the anode is normally indicated by a slightly longer leg.
</li>
<li>The current required to power an LED is usually around 20 mA.
</li>
<li>The LED is a semi-conductor component. 
</li>
<li>The colour of the LED made fade over time due to heat and age.

<li>A loudspeaker (or loud-speaker or speaker) is an electroacoustic transducer; which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.
</li>
<li>The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone, but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal.
</li>
<li>When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves.
