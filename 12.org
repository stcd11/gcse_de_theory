** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 

When developing new designs, you must must consider how previous designs were tackled. 
This information can help inform the current design decisions.
* Natural timbers: Hardwoods
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- comes from a tree with broad leaves
- grow slowly and can take up to 100 years before they are ready to harvest
- rarely planted so becoming scarse and expensive.

** Oak
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- strong and durable
- attractive grain
- expensive
- becoming rarer
- not the easiest wood to work with
- corrodes iron and steel
- historically used for building houses and boat
- more recently used for making high end furniture and wine/whisky barrels.

** Mahogany
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- quite easy to work with
- very attractive grain
- expensive
- environmental problems with sourcing from tropical forests
- oils in the wood can cause skin rashes and breathing problems
- used for making high-quality furniture, jewellery boxes and windows.



** Beech
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- a tough wood
- hard
- does not crack or splinter easily
- expensive
- not very resistant to moisture
- not suitable for exterior (outside) use
- used for making toys, cooking implements, solid and laminated furniture.

** Balsa
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- very light
- easy to cut
- much too soft and weak for most products
- used for model making, surf board cores
- historically used for rafts. 

* Natural timbers: Softwoods
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- come from tree with needle-like leaves and seeds in a cone
- mainly evergreens
- grow quickly, only needs 30 years before harvest
- grown commericially
- much cheaper than hardwoods

Here are some examples:

** Pine
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Very durable
- Easy to work
- Quite cheap as it grows quickly enough to be forested
- reasonable strong, lightweight and easy to work with
- can warp, crack and splinter more than some other woods
- used for house construction in roof joists and floorboards
- used internally for furniture and doors.
** Cedar
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Natural oils make it water and fungal growth resistant
- not as strong and more expensive than pine
- used for furniture, fences, shed and boats.

* Manufactured timbers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- by being manufactured there are no limitations to the size of boards available
- changes the properties of the natural wood.

Here are some examples:

** Plywood
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Layers of tree trunk called veneer are glued together with the grain lines going in alternate directions
- Flat, strong and looks like wood
- Resistant to warping, cracking and twisting
- quite expensive
- edges can look rough
- susceptible to water damage if the wrong grade is used. Marine ply is available
- used for building and panels that need strength. 
** Medium density fibreboard (MDF)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- wood dust and fibres are mixed with a glue and pressed into flat sheets under extreme pressure and heat
- cheap as made from waste wood
- smooth and ungrained so good for painting or staining
- easily manufactured
- needs coating as not very aesthic
- weak compare to real wood or plywood
- used for cheap flat pack furniture, wall panels, display cabinet and storage units.

* Properties
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Hardness
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- the ability to withstand cutting and scratching.
- most timbers are soft and easily cut with metal tools
- oak is quite hard for a wood
- balsa is very soft for a wood
- not to be confused with hardwoods and softwoods.
** Toughness
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- the ability of a material to withstand being hit
- a tough material can bend and deform without breaking
- wood is a tough material as it can be dented with a hammer but not break.
** Durability
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- the ability of a material to last a long time
- if a wood has been properly dried and kept dry it can last for hundreds of years like oak beams in old buildings
- wet wood can rot quickly and is not durable
- some woods have natural oils which improve their durable abilities
- can be treated with preservatives to make it more durable for external use.

* Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Trees are divided into hardwoods and softwoods
- different types of trees have different properties
- knowledge of the properties of different timbers is important in choosing the best timber of the product
- manufactured boards can be large flat sheets
- hard, tough and durable are properties used for describing timber.
* Exam questions
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- What is the difference between a hardwood and softwood?
- What type of timber would you make a coffee table from? Give reasons why you think it is a good choice
- What kind of things were often made from oak?
- Why is beech a good wood for a child's toy?
- Suggest a postive and a negative quality of MDF.
