** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 

When developing new designs, you must must consider how previous designs were tackled. 
This information can help inform the current design decisions.
* Freehand sketching
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Freehand sketches are drawings that are created using no technical equipment such as T squares, set squares and rulers. 
- Allows to show ideas in 3D and/or 2D.

To make it more effective:
- *different media*, i.e. using pencils, ball point pens, fine liners, marker pens or coloured pencils.
- *grid paper* can be helpful in showing scale or added a human figure.
- *use of arrows* is a good way to show movement in certain directions.

* Digital photography / media
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Ideas are created by editing photos and media. 
- Can be as simple as tracing over the top of an existing photograph.
- Often used in making billboard advertising for new films.

* Cut and paste techniques
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Used by fashion designers to use existing photos/images to help and inspire their own designs.
- Again can be achieved by using tracing paper over an existing photo.

* 3D models
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- To help the user visual the end product prototypes or 3D models are sometimes made.
- can be full size or smaller scale
- can be made from a variety of materials - paper, fabric, cardboard, stryofoam or HIPS.
- can be made from small plastic building bricks
- system modelling can use breadboards or stripboard
- computer modelling to make 3D printed models and simulations.

* 3D drawing
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
Can be isometric, oblique, one point perspective or two-point perspective.
** Oblique and isometric projections
:PROPERTIES:

*Isometric projections*

*Oblique projections*

** One point perspective drawing
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Often used in interior design.
- Construction lines point in the distance to a single point called the vanishing point.

** Two point perspective drawing
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Two-point perspective uses two vanishing points, connected by a horizontal line. 
- Two-point perspective is useful when developing ideas in 3D.

** Orthographic and exploded views
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Orthographic projection uses a 2D drawing of each side of an object. 
- Orthographic drawings usually consist of a front view, a side view and a plan view. 
- A drawing board and parallel motion or T-square is used to project one view from another.
- Orthographic drawing may be done using first angle projection or third angle projection.

*Exploded view*

** Assembly drawings
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- An assembly drawing shows how parts of a product fit together. 
- They are often used to show how to assemble parts of model kits and flat-pack furniture.
- There are two types:
- A fitted assembly drawing shows the parts put together, and can be drawn in 2D or 3D.
- An exploded drawing shows the parts separated, but in the correct relationship for fitting together. Exploded views are usually drawn in 3D, as illustrated.

* Systems and schematic diagrams
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- used mainly for electronic projects
- shows the inputs, processes and outputs

*Schematic*

- maybe hand drawn or made using a computer package such as Circuit Wizard.

* Computer aided design and specialist drawing programs
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
 
Computer aided design or CAD can be used in a number of different ways such as:
- CAD freehand sketching
- 2D modelling
- 3D modelling
- System design


- Often used to design items to be made using computer aided manufacture (CAM) - like a lasercutter or 3D printer.

* Record and justify design ideas clearly - annotated sketches
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Annotation can be used with all of the above techniques.
- They help to explain the ideas without the need to speak to them directly.
- The can vary depending on what stage of the design process they are being used.

*Design justifications:*
- user and design requirements
- pros and cons of each design
- ergonomics
- sustainability considerations
*Manufacturing details:*
- materials and components
- dimensions
- manufacturing process and techniques
- sources of energy e.g. batteries, main, solar, wind etc.

* Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
