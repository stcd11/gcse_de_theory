In this section you should know about the types, properties, structure and uses of thermoforming and thermosetting polymers.
- Polymers are everywhere and have a wide range of uses.
- A synthetic polymer is usually made from oil based petrochemicals, but coal and gas can also be used.
- There are two main types – thermoset and thermoformed.

** Thermoforming polymers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
One of the their biggest advantages is that they can be recycled – less waste etc.
- The list of thermoforming polymers is extensive – including:
- Acrylic
- High impact polystyrene (HIPS)
- Biodegradable polymers i.e. Biopol.

** Thermosetting polymers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
One of the their biggest advantages is that they are heat, chemical and solvent safe i.e. they will not change shape while being exposed to the above conditions.
- The list of thermoforming polymers is extensive – including:
- Polyester resin
- Urea formaldehyde
