* Sensors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Sensors are input components which change their value when the surrounding conditions change.
- These are analogue input components.
** Light-Dependant Resistors (LDR)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used to detect light levels, for example, in automatic security lights. Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases:
 1. In the dark and at low light levels, the resistance of an LDR is high, and little current can flow through it.
 2. In bright light, the resistance of an LDR is low, and more current can flow through it.
- LDRs are also useful for controlling how long the shutter should remain open on a digital camera. Changes in the resistance are measured and, if the light level is low, the shutter stays open for longer than if the light level is high.
- To read more about LDRs, click on [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/edexcel_pre_2011/electricityintheory/voltagecurrentresistancerev6.shtml][this]] link to go to the BBC bitesize website.

** Thermistor
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Thermistors are used as temperature sensors, for example, in fire alarms. Their resistance decreases as the temperature increases:
 1. At low temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is high, and little current can flow through them.
 2. At high temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is low, and more current can flow through them.

[[./img/thermistor_symbol.jpg]]
** Moisture Sensor
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content.
- Moisture sensors have 2 metal probes, these probes are inserted and then a small electrical current is passed between them. 
- As the moisture level increases, the electrical resistance decreases, this allows the current to increase. 
- This increase in current can be detected and used to control outputs.
- A typical example of this is a soil moisture level meter. When the moisture content drops, the sensor can pick this up and turn on a water supply until the moisture level is correct again.

** Piezoelectric Sensor
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A piezoelectric sensor is a device that uses the piezoelectric effect, to measure changes in pressure, acceleration, temperature, strain, or force by converting them to an electrical charge. The prefix piezo- is Greek for 'press' or 'squeeze'.
[[./img/piezo.gif]]
- The electric pulse can give a signal to the controller, which can then set off an alarm.
- The most common of these are microphones, these sense sound vibrations and convert them to electrical signals which can then be amplified to drive a loudspeaker.
* Control Devices and Components
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Some components can be used to control circuits.
** Single Pole Single Throw Switch (SPST)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A Single Pole Single Throw (SPST) switch is a switch that only has a single input and can connect only to one output. This means it only has one input terminal and only one output terminal. 
[[./img/SPST.jpg]]
[[./img/SPST2.jpg]]
- A Single Pole Single Throw switch serves in circuits as on-off switches. When the switch is closed, the circuit is on. When the switch is open, the circuit is off.
- SPST switches are, thus, very simple in nature. 
** Resistors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
- A resistor is used to either protect components from too much current or to divide up the voltage or current as needed in a circuit.

- Symbol:
[[./img/resistor_symbol.jpg]]
** Push to Make Switch (PTM)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A push to make switch allows electricity to flow between its two contacts when held in. When the button is released, the circuit is broken. This type of switch is also known as a Normally Open (NO) Switch.

** Micro Switch
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an "over-center" mechanism.
- Switching happens reliably at specific and repeatable positions of the actuator, which is not necessarily true of other mechanisms.
- They are very common due to their low cost and durability, greater than 1 million cycles and up to 10 million cycles for heavy duty models.
- This durability is a natural consequence of the design.
[[./img/micro_switch.jpg]]
- The symbol is the same as that of a normal switch.
** Reed Switch
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- The reed switch is an electrical switch operated by an applied magnetic field.
- It consists of a pair of contacts on ferromagnetic metal reeds in a hermetically sealed glass envelope.
- The contacts may be normally open, closing when a magnetic field is present, or normally closed and opening when a magnetic field is applied.

** Variable Resistors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A potentiometer (variable resistor) is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.
- An LDR is also a variable resistor. The resistance changes with the light level.
- A thermistor is also a variable resistor, the resistance changes with the temperature.

** Microprocessor
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits.A
- Microprocessors are mainly made up of silicon based transistors.
- These vary in size and complexity. 
[[./img/microprocessor.jpg]]
** Microcontrollers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A microcontroller is commonly known as a PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller).
- A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit, or UC for Î¼-controller) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit.
- A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. 
- They contain flash memory, which means we can write programs to them and then if we choose to, we can delete the program and re-write it.
- This provides the user with great flexibility as you can change to program as and when you need to.
- The PIC comes in many shapes and sizes, the one we use regularly is the Genie 08 PIC.
[[./img/Genie_08.jpg]]
- The pinouts can be seen in the image, some pins can be changed as either inputs or outputs.
[[./img/Genie_08_real.jpg]]
** Relays
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A relay is an electrically operated switch. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating principles are also used, such as solid-state relays.
- Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal.

#+end_html
- Using a relay allows the user to keep the low voltage completely seperate from the high voltage side. This keeps the user safe from harm as they are not in direct contact with the high voltage side.
- Below are some videos of a relay working.

** Transistors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.
- It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.
- A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals.
- Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. 
[[./img/Transistor_(cropped).jpg]]
- Symbol:
[[./img/NPN_transistor.png]]
- Here is a video of the LDR and transistor working to control an LED.
- The LED turns off when the light level is reached.

* Outputs
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Electronic outputs are devices which we can control by the system you have designed. 
- Output comonents can be very simple, like and LED to far more complex devices such as LCD displays and stepper motor control.
** Buzzers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short).
- Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

** Light-Emitting Diodes (LED)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A light-emitting diode (LED) is a special kind of diode that glows when electricity passes through it.
- Most LEDs are made from a semi-conducting material called gallium arsenide phosphide.
- LEDs can be bought in a range of colours. They can also be bought in forms that will switch between two colours (bi-colour), three colours (tri-colour) or emit infra-red light.
- In common with all diodes, the LED will only allow current to pass in one direction.
- The cathode is normally indicated by a flat side on the casing and the anode is normally indicated by a slightly longer leg.
- The current required to power an LED is usually around 20 mA.
- The LED is a semi-conductor component. 
- The colour of the LED made fade over time due to heat and age.

** Loudspeakers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A loudspeaker (or loud-speaker or speaker) is an electroacoustic transducer; which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.
- The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone, but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal.
- When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves.
[[./img/loudspeaker.gif]]
- A loudspeaker will require an amplifier to drive the coil in the speaker and produce sound.

** Motors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- A motor is a device which converts electrical energy into rotary motion.
- Microcontrollers can be used to turn a motor on and off as well as change the direction of the motor.
- The speed of the motor can also be controlled using PWM(Pulse Width Modulation).
- Most motors do not have a lot of torque and therefore need to be geared up or down using a gearbox.
- There are many different types of motors. Here are a few, but there are many more:
 1. DC motor
 2. AC motor
 3. Servo motor
 4. Stepper motor
 5. Brushless motor
