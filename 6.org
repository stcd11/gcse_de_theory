e* Introduction

:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: intro
:END:

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- This is a very basic introduction into core electronics for all DT students. We are going to cover all of these and more in our specified specialised topic  *Systems*. 
-  Electronic systems can have one or many inputs and outputs and a controller between them.
- The system read in the input signals and controls the the output signals according to the instructions in the program it has been given.

INPUT DEVICE > CONTROL > OUTPUT DEVICE

* Sensors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Light dependent resistor(LDR)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- When the light falls on the sensor its resistance changes:
- in the light the resistance is low so the electrons flow
- in the dark the resistance is high so not much electricity flows.
** Thermistor
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:	
- is a temperature dependent resistor.
- Its resistance changes with temperature 
- in the warm, the resistance is low
- in the cold, the resistance is high

* Control component and devices
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- As well as sensors there other components that can provide input into a circuit.
** Single Throw Switch
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- This is an on and off switch for simply controlling the circuit to be on or off. 
** Resistors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- this component changes the resistance of a circuit.
- It limits the flow of the electrons.
- This maybe to protect delicate components e.g. LEDs or to help control the flow of electricity around a circuit such as using a pull down resistor.

** Transistors
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- acts like a tiny electronic switch.
- They have three legs - base, collector and emitter.
- The are made from a semi-conductor and the base acts as a gate controlling the flow from the emitter to the collector.
- They are useful in sensing circuits to amplify the small current you get from some sensors.
- They can be extremely small by etching them into silicon wafers known as silicon chips. A mobile phone may contain 2 billion transistor
* Outputs
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Buzzer
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:      
- A buzzer is an audio device than can be useful as a warning sound.

** Light-emitting diode(LED)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- This gives out light when electricity is passed through, in a range of colours, that can be powerful to light a whole room.

* Definition 
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Input device
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Something that can give an input signal to the system.
** Output device
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:
- Something that can responses to an instruction to change from the control system.
** Input signal
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- Information give to the system from an input device.
** Output signal
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- An instruction the system gives to an output device.
** Program
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:
- A set of instructions the system controller has been given to make the electronic system do what it is supposed to do. 
- A transistor can bypass the need for a program as a simple switching action happens due to the rise in voltage on the base of the transistor above 0.6 Volts.
** Resistance
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- An electrical quantity that is a measure of how the device or wire reduces the electric current flow through it.
** Component
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- An individual part of a circuit
** Circuit
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- Individual parts  are joined together with a conductive material so electricity can flow through them and perform a task.
** Voltage
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- The amount of potential electrical force available that could make electricity flow.
** Current
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- The amount of electricity that is flowing through a circuit.
** Semi-conductor
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- A material that allows electricity to flow under certain conditions. It can behave as an insulator or conductor.
