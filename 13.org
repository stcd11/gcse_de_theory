** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

Designers use their understanding of the properties of materials and how those materials can be manipulated to inform their design decisions.
** Using materials, components and process to inform outcomes One-off
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- *Properties of materials and components*, when choosing materials or components for a design, manufacturers must consider the mechanical or physical properties required to ensure the material will perform the task.
- Mechanical - elements of a material that resist deformation from external forces or loads.
- Physical - elements of a material that can be defined and measured, such as colour, size or weight.

** Advantages and disadvantages of materials, components and manufacturing processes
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
Elements that are analysed:
- Available forms in which the materials and components are supplied.
- Mechanical and physical properties of the materials
- Availablility of the tools, equipment and processes
- Scale of production
- Ease of the materials to process
- Level of waste
- Energy demands in the construction process
- Quantities, cost and availability of the materials

** Justifying materials, components and manufacturing processes
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
The manufacturer can justify why it chose its materials and manufacturing processes in several ways. Below are some examples. This is also covered in topic 1.14.
- Producing tests pieces to prove that the materials have the desired physical and mechanical properties.
- Producing prototypes using manufacturing processes that could have been used for the final product to show how it could be made.
- Producing a full economic case for the product, considerting factors such as the cost of materials and processing, and hidden costs of manufacturing such as labour, lighting, waste and transportation.
- Evaluating the materials and production methods in relation to the environment and society.

* Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
*Key points to remember:*
- Designers need to use understand the key physical and mechanical properties of materials to inform the design decisions.
- Manufacturers need to match materials appropriate manufacturing methods.
- Businesses need to justify their selection of materials and processes before manufacturing begins.

* Exam questions
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Disposable cutlery is made from high-impact polystrene(HIPS). Give five properties of HIPS and explain why these properties are required in this product.
- Explain two factors that companies may consider whenc choosing a manufacturing process.
- Explain two ways a company could justify their choice of manufacturing process.
- Identify ten products in your home. Use the list of mechanical properities in the above table to identify whci properties are important to these products and why.
- Identify the manufacturing processes involved in the construction of thses ten products and justify why these manufacturing processes were used.
