** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

* Energy Storage
:PROPERTIES:

** Batteries and cells
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Batteries convert chemical energy to electrical energy. This chemical reaction causes electrons to collect on the negative terminal.
- When a battery or cell is connected in the circuit, current is forced to flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.
- A battery is defined as 2 or more cells. Each cell having approximately 1.5V, depending on the types of chemical used in the cell.
- Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, the most common round cell sizes are D, C, AA, AAA and AAA.
- The 'rectangular' battery we use is the PP3 battery, which runs at 9V.
[[./img/Battery_sizes.png]]
- Prismatic cells are flexible cells.These are very expensive to manufacture, but recharge easily.
- They tend to have a shorter lif than the standard cylindrical cell.
- These are regularly used in mobile phones, small electronic toys and low profile laptops.

** Solar cells(photovoltaic cells)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- These cell convert light energy into electrical energy. The light being produced from the sun is often used.
- They contain 2 layers of silicon, treated to allow electrons to flow when the sunlight fall on them.
- This is an environmentally friendly way of producing energy after the initial cost to purchase and the manufacturing process.
- The down side is they do not produce energy when there is no light, they take up valuable space (solar farms) and they do not always match the environment they are in.

** Mains electricity
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Supplied from power stations through the national grid.

This is supplied to households at 230V alternating current (AC). This current changes direction 50 times per second, therefore the frequency is at 50Hz.

This energy can be harmful to humans and animals if touched due to the high voltage and current produced.

Most of the mains electricity still come from burning fossil fuels.
#+END_VERSE
** Wind Power
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Converts the movement of the air (wind) into mechanical power which can the be used to spin a generator, producing the electricity needed.

Groups of wind turbines can create significant amounts of energy, less useful on a smaller scale.

Small scale versions are built for home use.

The amount of energy produced is directly dependant on the amount of wind blowing.

* Choosing the appropriate energy sources
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity

** Portability of power source
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- You will need to consider how portable the divice you are going to use or design needs to be. 
- If your equipment needs a power source at 220V A.C. then you can use a converter to convert D.C. voltage (usually 12V from a car battery) to the 220V A.C. needed for the equipment.
** Environmental impact
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- There is no energy source that is completely environmentally friendly. The production of the device will in most cases involve some level of fossil fuel emmisions, or an impact on wildlife habitation in order to extract materials.
- Some of the impact mat not be entirely noticeable, these ar known as passive impacts. This could be noise emission, such as those generated by wind turbines.
- There also needs to be a consideration for where the materials come from and how they are transported to the manufacturer and then onto the customer. All of these will usually involve the use of shipping and trucks.
** Power output
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- The amount of energy produced is not consistent, it depends greatly on the type of powerplant used to generate the electricity. 
- Most renewable energy do not produce electricity predictably or consistently. For example, wind turbines will only prouduce energy when the wind is blowing within a particular range.
- A designer must consider these factors and select an energy source suitable for the product they are designing.
** Circuit/System connections
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- A designer will need to consider how the product they have made will connect to the power source. For example, if you are using a PP3 9V battery, you will need to use a battery snap.
** Cost
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Different energy sources have different financial costs.
- Batteries can be very expensive and do not provide long term power.
- The cost of setting up alternative power solutions must be carefully considered by the designer.
