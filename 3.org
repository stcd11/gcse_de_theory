** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Non-renewable Energy
- Non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels that were formed from the remains of animals and plants that lived millions of years ago. They cannot be replenished quickly and will eventually run out.

Heat energy and hot gases convert water into steam which powers a turbine to create high-voltage electricity.

Smaller amounts are used as a domestic heat source.

*Advantages:*

- Stable, large-scale and high-power electricity generation.
- Relatively cheap to extract and convert.
- Reliable

*Disadvantages:*

- Coal power plants emit pollution such as carbon dioxide, sulfur, mercury, selenuim and arsenic.
- Technologies to reduce coal power plant emissions are expensive.
- Coal mining impacts significantly on the landscape.

** Oil
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
 #+BEGIN_VERSE
Processed and split into petroleum products such as petrol, paraffin and diesel.

In power plants, oil is burnt to heat water and produce steam, which propels turbine blades to produce electricity.

*Advantages:*

- Stable, large-scale and high-power electricity generation.
- Relatively cheap to extract and convert

*Disadvantages:*

- Oil power plants are highly polluting.
- Oil exploration impacts on the landscape.
- Oil extraction risks environmental disasters.

** Gas
:PROPERTIES:

 #+BEGIN_VERSE
Burning gas can power turbines, with the waste heat powering a steam turbine.

Natural gas is used in homes for heating or cooking.

It has lower emissions than ther fossil fuels - its combustion emits carbon dioxide at half the rate of coal.
*Advantages:*

- Stable, large-scale and high-power electricity generation.
- Relatively cheap to extract as ready-made fuel.
- Cleaner than coal or oil.

*Disadvantages:*

- Burning gases are highly polluting.

** Batteries and cells
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Batteries convert chemical energy to electrical energy. This chemical reaction causes electrons to collect on the negative terminal.
- When a battery or cell is connected in the circuit, current is forced to flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.
- A battery is defined as 2 or more cells. Each cell having approximately 1.5V, depending on the types of chemical used in the cell.
- Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, the most common round cell sizes are D, C, AA, AAA and AAA.
- The 'rectangular' battery we use is the PP3 battery, which runs at 9V.
[[./img/Battery_sizes.png]]
- Prismatic cells are flexible cells.These are very expensive to manufacture, but recharge easily.
- They tend to have a shorter lif than the standard cylindrical cell.
- These are regularly used in mobile phones, small electronic toys and low profile laptops.

** Solar cells(photovoltaic cells)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- These cell convert light energy into electrical energy. The light being produced from the sun is often used.
- They contain 2 layers of silicon, treated to allow electrons to flow when the sunlight fall on them.
- This is an environmentally friendly way of producing energy after the initial cost to purchase and the manufacturing process.
- The down side is they do not produce energy when there is no light, they take up valuable space (solar farms) and they do not always match the environment they are in.
