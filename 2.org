e* Introduction

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: intro

** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Critical evaluation
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Before making a product when need to critically evaluate a number of fields. 
- Critical evaluation is a process of trying to find both positive and negatives from a range of areas to assess the suitability of concepts such as a design, process or material.
- Basically it is asking lots and lots of questions!
- Some of the areas to be looked at are:

** Manufacturing capabilities
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Will the new technology influence the way products are made? 3D printers that can make other 3D printers?
- Will automated assembly lines produce high quality customised products?
- Will new technologies enable a flexible reaction to demand?

** Budget constraints
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- How much are customers willing to pay? Is a Â£1000 mobile phone viable? Ask Apple!
- Will cost affect material selection, production methods and cost of labour?
- Will the new technologies improve value and maximise profit?
- Can cost savings be made by speed of manufacture, reduction in materials, reduction in size or process redesign?

** Materials being used
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Have the materials been tested for the required use?
- Will improvements outweigh any increased costs?
- Are the materials sustainable?

** Timescales
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Will production times be cut?
- Is a time investment in staff training needed?
- What lead times do customers expect?
** Who is the product for?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- How can the technologies help the product fulfil the customer needs?
- Has the target market been researched?

* Consideration of contemporary and potential future scenarios
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- When making design decisions we must examine possible outcomes. These could be positive, negative or even both!

** Natural disasters
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Disasters such as hurricanes and floods appear to be happening more and more. 
- Can developments in technology help us to prevent, prepare and cope with these situation i.e. earthquake-proof buildings?

** Medical advances
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Examples maybe future ideas such as Artifical organs or more current thinking such as prosthetic limbs.
- Better technology to scan and detect problems such as MRI scanners.
- Also if people are living longer can technology help in a society that is ageing.
- This[[https://getreferralmd.com/2017/01/17-future-healthcare-technology-advances-of-2017-referralmd/][ article]] has 17 advances just in 2017!
 
** Travel
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Despite technological advances in transport no real big changes have happened in 50 years. Commerical airlines are actually flying slower than they did 30 years ago!
- Most forms of travel are safe, comfortable and efficient.
- Could a this be the next big leap?

** Global warming
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Could low-carbon and zero carbon technology help lower the emissions of greenhouse gases which are probably causing global warming?

- In the building industry this may include:
- biomass technology
- CHP (Micro CHP)
- ground source heat pumps
- photovoltaics
- solar hot water
- wind energy technology.


** Communication
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Revolutionised by the internet, communication is now cheap, easy and reliable. But designers have to be aware that their target audience may not have access to hardward, software and power sources.
  
* Ethical perspectives
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- Here is an example of company acting in an ethical manner.

#+END_HTML
- These companies act not purely for profit and are thinking of the wider consequences of their business. 
- This might be actly fairly in terms of their workers or supplier or damage to the environment from their trade.

* Environmental persectives
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Use of materials
- Designer should be choosing materials that are: recyclable, lighter and less toxic.
- Metals involving mining
- Oil is a finite resource and cause pollution at all stages including not decomposing when finished it.
- Read this[[http://ecosalon.com/a-handy-reference-guide-to-the-20-greenest-materials/][ article]] about the most green materials currently available.
 
** Carbon footprint
- Carbon footprint is the amount of CO2 emissions that can be directly or indirectly caused by an individual or company's activities.
- The smaller the footprint, the least damage is done to the environment.
- Work out your carbon footprint [[https://www.treesforlife.org.au/kids-carbon-calculator?PHPSESSID%3D63e50abc9c5d98fbff2681be1e4e90a6][here]]
** Manufacture and tranportation: energy usage and consumption
- costs from manufacture maybe noise and visual pollution.
- costs from transport maybe the burning of petroleum which harms the environment.
** Life analysis

- A life cycle analysis(LCA) is a systematic inventory of environment impacts at every stage of a product's life. 
- Governments are trying to get all businesses to carry out LCAs so improvements to the environmental impact at each stage can be found.

 
- Watch this video on the life cycle of a plastic bottle:
